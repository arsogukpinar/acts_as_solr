Basic Usage
======
<pre><code>
# Just include the line below to any of your ActiveRecord models:

  class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_solr
  end

# With this acts_as_solr will index all string and text fields on your
# active_record model

# Or if you want, you can specify only the fields that should be indexed:

  class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_solr :fields => [:name, :author]
  end

# The "fields" that are going to be indexed don't need to be database fields,
# they can be simple methods on your model:

  class Book < ActiveRecord::Base

    belongs_to :author

    acts_as_solr :fields => [:name, :author_name]

    def author_name
      self.author.name if self.author
    end

  end

# Then to find instances of your model, just do:
  books = Book.find_by_solr(query)

# "query" is a string representing your query
# You can find out more about Lucene's query sintax here:
# http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_1/queryparsersyntax.html

# Finding using pagination:

  books = Book.find_by_solr( query, :page => 2, :per_page => 10 )

# The object returned by a find_by_solr call is an ActsAsSolr::SearchResults
# object where you can find out more about the response Solr sent back to you and
# the real active_record objects returned by your query.

# This object works just like any other Enumerable (as an Array) and you can
# call any Enumerable method on it. It's also completely compatible with 
# will_paginate view helpers.

  books = Book.find_by_solr( query, :page => 2, :per_page => 10 )
  books.each do |book| # this "book" variable is a real Book object from the database
    puts "#{book.name} - #{book.author_name} - #{book.year}"
  end

# Please see ActsAsSolr::ActsMethods for a complete info
